### Errors & Warnings

Fatal errors in the React Native are visually indicated through a red box. Read the error message carefully. The reason for an error is shown there with the reference to your source code. You can also see the error message in your terminal.

You can also generate your own errors and warnings by using `console.error` or `console.warn`.

For example:
```js
console.warn("HelloÂ there");
```
