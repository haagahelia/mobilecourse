**React Native Paper** (https://reactnativepaper.com/) is a popular open-source UI library for React Native applications. It provides a set of customizable and pre-designed components that follow Google's Material Design.

### Installation
- Install React Native Paper UI library to your project by typing the following command in your project's folder.
```bash
npm install react-native-paper
```
- You also have to install `react-native-safe-area-context` to handle safe area. Safe areas are areas of the screen that are guaranteed not to be obstructed by system bars or notches on devices.
```bash
npm install react-native-safe-area-context
```
In the following example project, we will learn some of the components that library provides.

### Example Project

We create GitExplore app for searching GitHub repositories based on user-provided keywords. It is similar app that we already delveloped in the Networking section but now we build the user interface using React Native Paper components. SThe app also allows users to view repository details in a browser. The app looks the following:
